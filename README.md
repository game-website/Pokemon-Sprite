<a href="https://pokemon-infinite-fusion.coderobo.org/pokemon-sprite/">Pokemon sprite</a> have come a long way since the franchise debuted in 1996. Let's take a nostalgic walk through the visual history of Pokemon sprites and see how they have evolved over 25 years.

What Are Pokemon Sprites?
Pokemon sprites are 2D pixel art representations of each Pokemon species in the games. They depict Pokemon in battles, menus, maps, and Pokedex entries with unique animations and characteristics.

The Origins - 8-bit Sprites
Pokemon Red and Blue on the Game Boy featured very basic sprite work with limited pixels, colors, and movement. But these retro 8-bit sprites are still iconic today. Charizard, Pikachu, and other Gen 1 Pokemon are instantly recognizable in their original sprite form.

Sprites Evolve on the Game Boy Color

Pokemon Gold and Silver upgraded to the Game Boy Color, allowing richer and more vibrant sprites with a wider color palette. The small animations helped bring Pokemon to life.

Entering a New Dimension on the GBA
Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire on Game Boy Advance were the first Pokemon games with large detailed sprites, often with multiple frames of animation. Battle sprites had dynamic perspectives and angles.

DS Brings Custom Animations
On the Nintendo DS, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl added even more sophisticated animations that were unique to each Pokemon's personality. Floating, bending, twisting - sprites became more expressive.

Animated Sprites Reach Their Peak
Pokemon Black and White perfected DS sprites with fluid, custom animations on par with 2D animated cartoons. Every Pokemon was brimming with energy.

The Jump to 3D Models
Pokemon X and Y marked the franchise's first steps into 3D graphics on the Nintendo 3DS. While 3D Pokemon models were used in battles, sprites stuck around for other parts of the game.

The End of an Era
Pokemon Sun and Moon mostly phased out sprites in favor of 3D models. But Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee briefly brought back updated HD sprites before the standard became 3D going forward.

Sprites Leave a Lasting Legacy
While the sprite era has ended, these retro graphics will always hold a special place in Pokemon history. Red and Blue's simplistic sprites made the creatures instantly recognizable. And the advanced animated sprites of Gen 5 capture Pokemon personalities like no 3D models can.
